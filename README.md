Scrapping codes: Consulta Amigable Mensual (MEF).


Steps:
1) Get the Consulta Amigable website HTML code (imputed later in the Python codes). 
2) The Python codes scrap from the Consulta Amigable Mensual application (developed by the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Peru) to get both the monthly local government 
level of public spending by the concept of "Acquisition of Non-Financial Assets" (Genérica 6-26) and the monthly local government level of public spending by the concept of 
"Construction of buildings and structures" (Subgenérica 2: Construcción de edificios y estructuras). 

3) The Stata code cleans up duplicates and consolidates the databases for the local governments of Tumbes, Amazonas, Lambayeque, and Piura departments. 

** If you are interested in getting the Python codes for the remaining departments and government levels (national and regional), do not hesitate to contact me at
